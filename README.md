# 🎮 Simon Game – Memory Challenge

This is a modern version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — with a twist!  
Unlike the original, where the whole pattern is displayed every round…  
➡️ **Here, only the newest color flashes** each level ✅  
So you must remember the **entire sequence from the beginning**. Ready to test your brain? 😄

## 🧠 Game Rules

1️⃣ Press any key to start the game  
2️⃣ A single button (red/green/blue/yellow) flashes — remember it  
3️⃣ In the next round:
- ✅ A **new color** will flash  
- ❌ The game **will NOT repeat the full sequence**
4️⃣ Your task:
- 🔹 Click the **entire sequence in the correct order**

| 1     | Red       | Red |
| 2     | Green     | Red → Green |
