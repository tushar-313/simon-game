  <h2>🎮 How to Play the Simon Game</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Simon Game</strong> is a fast-paced memory game where your goal is to repeat a growing sequence of colors. Each round tests your focus and memory as a new color is added to the sequence — but in this version, the game only shows <strong>the newest color</strong>, so you'll need to remember the full sequence on your own!
  </p>

  <h3>🟢 Objective:</h3>
  <p>
    Repeat the full sequence of colors in the correct order. Each level, <strong>one new color is added</strong>, but <strong>only the new color will flash</strong>, so you must recall and repeat the entire pattern from memory.
  </p>

  <h3>📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start the Game:</strong> Press any key from keyboard to <em>Start</em> the game.. A single color button (red, green, blue, or yellow) will flash briefly — this is the first color in the sequence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Memorize the Sequence:</strong> Remember the color that flashed. In the next round, a <strong>new color</strong> will be added, but <em>only that new color</em> will blink.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Repeat the Full Sequence:</strong> After the flash, <strong>you must click the entire sequence in order</strong>, from the first round up to the current one.<br>
      Example:
      <ul>
        <li>Round 1: red → click red</li>
        <li>Round 2: (new color is green) → click red, green</li>
        <li>Round 3: (new color is blue) → click red, green, blue</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advance Through Levels:</strong> Each round adds one new color to the sequence. The game becomes more challenging as the sequence gets longer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Game Over:</strong> If you click the wrong color in the sequence, the game ends. A “Game Over” message will appear, and your score will be displayed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Restart the game and aim to beat your previous high score!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>💡 Pro Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pay close attention to the <strong>new color</strong> that appears each round.</li>
    <li>Replay the sequence in your mind before clicking.</li>
    <li>Play in a quiet and focused environment to improve concentration.</li>
  </ul>
